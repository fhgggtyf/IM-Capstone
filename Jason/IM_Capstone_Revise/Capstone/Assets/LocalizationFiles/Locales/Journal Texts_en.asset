    m_Localized: 'Today is Saturday, Kairo, and I should have gone to the park today.
      At breakfast, Mommy said that we are no longer allowed. Kairo was very upset.
      He told me that, but he didn''t tell mommy and daddy. He says he understands,
      but it is still unfair.

    m_Localized: "Today was very scary. I was helping Mommy prepare dinner in the
      kitchen, and we heard very loud bangs coming from the door. Daddy was about
      to open it, but a big man was already inside and even pushed Daddy to the floor.
      I did not know what to do, Mommy also did not know, she only took me and covered
      my eyes. I can hear Kairo crying. Daddy seemed to be in a lot of pain, too.
      The big man approached mommy and said things I did not understand. But I understood
      \u201CThis is the law, and he made a mistake.\u201D  Then daddy and the big
      men were all gone. "

    m_Localized: "I asked Mommy if Daddy will ever come back. She didn't really say
      anything, but I can tell she is thinking very deeply. Kairo has been taking
      care of different chores around the house. He even forces me to do some of
      them. Usually, I would tell him \u201Cno,\u201D but I\u2019m only doing it
      because Mommy is tired now. "

    m_Localized: "Mommy, she needs to go look for Daddy. She doesn't know when she\u2019ll
      be back, but she said Kairo and I need to look after each other. Kairo did
      not say a word, he didnt even look at mommy when she stood at the door smiling
      as she wore daddy\u2019s scarf. She warned us that it is best to stay in and
      not go out. And most importantly to not let anyone in or trust whoever comes
      by. "
